    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use ApertureDB as part of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation [Langchain](/Integrations/langchain_howto) pipeline.  This means that we're going to use ApertureDB as a vector-based search engine to find documents that match the query and then use a large-language model to generate an answer based on those documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will:\n",
    "* Create prompts for the LLM\n",
    "* Create an embedding model\n",
    "* Configure a connection to ApertureDB\n",
    "* Set up ApertureDB as a LangChain vectorestore\n",
    "* Convert the vectorstore into a document retriever\n",
    "* Create an LLM\n",
    "* Build LangChain chains for both RAG and non-RAG\n",
    "* Run the chains with a question\n",
    "* Review the answers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already completed the notebook [Ingesting a Website into ApertureDB](./website_ingest), then your ApertureDB instance should already contain text from your chosen website.\n",
    "We'll use that to answer natural-language questions.\n",
